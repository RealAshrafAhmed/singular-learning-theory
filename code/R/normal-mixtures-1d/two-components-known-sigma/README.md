# Two components normal mixture with known variance in 1 dimension

This project was created as a result a singular learning theory reading group at Waterloo University in Waterloo, ON., Canada. The first meeting of the reading group was in the fall of 2024.

## Description

Our goal is to develop a deeper understanding of singular learning theory by applying the theory to different classical problems in statistical inference such as mixture models, hierarchical bayesian models, and bayesian deep networks.
